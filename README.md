<h1>RESERVE SYSTEM </h1>


This project aims to enhance file reading, data visualization, and various computational abilities using C language. The research process unfolds in two stages. 
In the first stage, coordinates are extracted from a given webpage URL to form 2D geometric shapes, calculating their areas to determine resource reserves. 
These coordinates form closed polygons, with the polygon's area representing 1/10 of the resource reserve.
In the second stage, the reserve areas of these polygons are partitioned into square parcels for drilling and resource operations, subject to constraints like drilling in the most extreme areas, minimizing platform count for cost efficiency,
and ensuring standardized square sizes without adjacent congruence. 
This step focuses on balancing drilling and platform costs to determine the most profitable or cost-effective scenario, optimizing both drilling expenses and platform count to maximize region productivity and revenue potential. 
The project encompasses extensive research, library integration, and application development, starting with the installation of SDL and cURL libraries. 
Following thorough analysis and adjustments to rectify drawing errors, algorithms were implemented to determine square placements within various geometric shapes.

<h1>TICKET SYSTEM </h1>



This project is focused on the development of OOP information systems to bolster fundamental programming skills and problem-solving capabilities using Java language.
It entails the creation of a comprehensive reservation platform enabling passengers to book travel with various transportation providers, spanning railways, roadways, and airways. 
The system architecture is designed with distinct admin, company, and user interfaces, each tailored to streamline interactions and facilitate efficient operations.
Leveraging Object-Oriented Programming principles, the JavaFX application encompasses essential classes. 
Through an intuitive user interface, individuals can seamlessly navigate through travel plans, search for available tickets, and securely make reservations. 
Furthermore, the system ensures effective management of company resources and vehicle attributes, fostering a user-friendly experience while optimizing operational efficiency across all aspects of the reservation process.
